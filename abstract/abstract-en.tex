The Software Architectures course teaches students the most important concepts on design and architecture of software systems and makes students apply these concepts to real, complex software systems. Organizing knowledge and applying theory to practice is not an easy task, and students often need to ask questions and discuss. State-of-the-art on collaborative, social software and knowledge structuring is analyzed and a social platform is proposed to solve the problems adjacent to this course.
