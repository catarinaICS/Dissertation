\begin{abstract}
The Software Architectures course at Instituto Superior T\'{e}cnico teaches students the most important concepts on design and architecture of software systems and helps students to apply these concepts to real and complex software systems. Organizing knowledge and applying theory to practice is not an easy task, and students often need to ask questions and discuss. State-of-the-art on collaborative, social software and knowledge structuring was analyzed and a social platform was developed to help solving these problems.
