\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

To my parents and my brother. Having a supporting family is a big plus. 

To my grandparents. Hopefully they would be proud of me if they could see me now.

To my boyfriend Jo\~{a}o, for all the help, for being my rock, always there whenever I needed (even when I was extremely annoying). What a long, strange trip it's been!

To my online friend Rasmus, for all the in chat support, even when he had no idea of what I was talking about.

To my advisor, professor Ant\'{o}nio Rito Silva, for all the support and all the help during this period.
