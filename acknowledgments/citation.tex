``In the end, I'm able to look back without shame or regretful nostalgia and think, \textit{You did something great. And something new will come around. Or not. Either way, do the work you love. And love yourself. That's all you can do in this world in order to be happy}'' 

- Felicia Day in \textit{``You're Never Weird on the Internet (Almost)''}
