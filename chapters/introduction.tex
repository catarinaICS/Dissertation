\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chapter:introduction}
Analyzing and discussing big, real, open-source and highly complex software system is a very important part of the Software Architectures course. In the course context, students must apply concepts and techniques for design and analysis of software architectures to descriptions of real systems. 

However, applying these concepts and techniques is not a very easy task, and often students have questions and doubts regarding these descriptions. These questions sometimes require not only consulting the course bibliography, but also discussing with peers or asking questions to teachers.

The following document is organized as follows: Section \ref{objectives} provides a more detailed description of the problem presented last paragraph and presents a possible solution for the problem. Section \ref{related} presents the state-of-the-art on the components of the solution. Section \ref{solarch} describes a possible solution for the problem and Section \ref{assessm} describes how the implemented solution will be assessed.
