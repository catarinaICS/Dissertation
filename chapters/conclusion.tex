The success of social software is very dependent on the people that use it, since it is focused on the interactions and collaboration between their users.

The implemented platform will be tested in the context of Social Architectures classes. Students will be encouraged to use all the platform's features and provide feedback throughout the testing period.

After the testing period, a survey should be done to students in order to evaluate the platform in terms of Usability (ease of use) and Performance. Additionally, an assessment will be done on the quality and effectiveness of the knowledge synthesis.
