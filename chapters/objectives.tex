\label{chapter:objectives}
To solve the mentioned problems, we intend to develop a platform, where students and teachers collaborate in the analysis and synthesis of the case descriptions, ending on a structured representation of the case descriptions, that is hooked on the concrete description. 

The platform will provide ways for annotating the text on the case descriptions, which will help students organizing their thoughts and creating the structure. 

To motivate the students to participate in this platform and to increase the collaborative component, elements of social software will be used (such as reputation and tagging systems), to promote, among other things, collaboration, mutual aid, discussion, learning, and even some healthy competition between students.
 
The existence of this collaborative platform provides not only a way for students to discuss, ask questions and consolidate their knowledge, but also a unique place where their study materials are stored and organized, facilitating their studies.
