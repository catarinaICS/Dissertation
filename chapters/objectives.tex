\chapter{Objectives}
\label{chapter:objectives}

To solve the problems mentioned in Chapter \ref{chapter:problemdescription}, a collaborative platform was planned and developed, where students and teachers collaborate in the analysis and synthesis of the case descriptions, ending on a structured representation of the case descriptions, that is hooked on the concrete description. 

The goal of the platform is to provide ways for annotating the text on the case descriptions, which will help students organizing their thoughts and creating the structure, and use elements of social software, as a way of promoting collaboration, mutual aid, learning and even some competition between students.
 
The existence of this collaborative should provide not only a way for students to discuss, ask questions and consolidate their knowledge, but also a unique place where their study materials are stored and organized, facilitating their studies.
